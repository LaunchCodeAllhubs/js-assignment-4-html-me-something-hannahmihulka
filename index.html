            <h3>the lyrics</h3>
            <p>And there was a booming above you,
                that night black airplanes flew over the sea.
                And they were lowing and shifting like
                beached whales,
                shelled snails,
                as you strained and you squinted to see
                the retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry.
            </p>
            <p>
                You froze in your sand shoal,
                prayed for your poor soul;
                sky was a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl.
            </p>

            </section>
            <p>
                And when the bread broke —
                fell in bricks of wet smoke —
                my sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke.
            </p>

                <h3>the lyrics</h3>
                <p>Time passed hard,
                    and the task was the hardest thing she'd ever do.
                    But she forgot,
                    the moment she saw you.

                <h3>the lyrics</h3>
                <p>That means no where I come from.
                    I am cold, and waiting for the day to come.
